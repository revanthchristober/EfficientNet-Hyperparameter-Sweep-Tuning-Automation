# **EfficientNet Hyperparameter Tuning Framework**

## **Overview**

EfficientNet Hyperparameter Tuning Framework is designed to automate the process of hyperparameter tuning for the EfficientNet family of models. This framework leverages Optuna for its robust and flexible hyperparameter optimization capabilities. It includes features such as dynamic model selection, efficient logging, and seamless integration with popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## **Features**

- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses Optuna to efficiently explore and optimize hyperparameters.
- **Dynamic Model Selection:** Supports various EfficientNet architectures, allowing for flexible experimentation.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Integrates with MLflow for detailed experiment tracking and analysis.
- **Scalability:** Compatible with distributed training frameworks to handle large-scale experiments.
- **Extensibility:** Easily extendable to include additional models or custom tuning strategies.

## **Installation**

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

### Basic Usage

To start a basic hyperparameter sweep with default settings:

```bash
python hyperparameter_sweep.py
```

### **Custom Configuration**

You can customize the hyperparameter sweep by modifying the configuration file `config.yaml`. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
model:
  name: "efficientnet_b0"
  pretrained: True

data:
  raw: 'data/raw'
  processed: 'data/processed'

results:
  logs: 'results/logs/'
  models: 'results/models/'
  metrics: 'results/metrics/'

hyperparameters:
  learning_rate:
    min: 1e-5
    max: 1e-2
    value: 0.001
  batch_size:
    values: [16, 32, 64]
    value: 64
  epochs:
    max: 100
  num_epochs: 10
  num_classes: 10

optuna:
  n_trials: 50
  direction: "maximize"
```

### **Logging and Tracking**

To enable logging with MLflow:

```bash
mlflow run .
```

This will track all experiments and their results, allowing you to visualize the performance and compare different runs.

## **Results**

The results of the hyperparameter sweeps are logged and saved in the `results` directory. This includes the best hyperparameters found, training logs, and model checkpoints.
